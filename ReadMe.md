History of Marvel Television


My project is about the History of Marvel Movies and Series.  
It is mainly about the superheroes movies that have came out most recently.  
I created a database to story the movies in order depending on which phase the movie or series took place.  
Right now there are only 3 phases for the movies and phases but in the future if there are more phase, they simply can be add to the database through the application itself.
I separted the movies and series so people can specifly see what Marvel movies there have been or what series there have been.
You look at each movie or series specifically to see what number in the collection it is, the rating of it, and description of it.
For movies I add how much in box office money they earned.
For Tv Series I add what service provider contians the series so you could possibly watch it in the future.  


To Do when you open the project:
-Open Tools in Microsoft Visual Studio
-Go to NuGet Package Manager
-Click on Package Manager Console
-In the console, type in update-database
-The seed method will run and enter data into the database
-Then press run and the application will open in your browser
